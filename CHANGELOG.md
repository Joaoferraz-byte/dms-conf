## 2026-08-31 — Lambda launcher icon stroke

The launcher lambda asset used `stroke-width="4"`, so its visual weight did not match the requested thick icon treatment. The SVG now uses `stroke-width="7"` while preserving its 24×24 viewBox and geometry, and the `noctalia-config` flake check now validates the same value.
