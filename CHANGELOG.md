The launcher lambda asset used `stroke-width="4"`, so its visual weight did not match the requested thick icon treatment. The SVG now uses `stroke-width="7"` while preserving its 24×24 viewBox and geometry, and the `noctalia-config` flake check now validates the same value.

## 2026-08-31 — FreeSM launcher argv execution

The provider built the configured launcher command as a shell string, concatenated `--launch <instance>` and redirected stderr. That made dynamic instance ids depend on shell parsing and hid the actual process result; the provider also had no notification path for a failed launch. Prism/Freesm's documented CLI accepts `--launch` as a normal argument.

The provider now tokenizes the configured command into argv, appends `--launch` and the instance id as separate arguments, uses Noctalia's direct argv form of `runAsync`, logs non-zero stderr and notifies the user when execution is rejected or fails. The old shell-string and redirection path is covered by flake checks.
